# SupportTools Website Rules

## Content Organization Pattern
- Blog posts should be placed directly in the `blog/content/post/` directory
- Do NOT create subdirectories for blog posts within the post directory
- Social media content MUST be organized in dedicated subdirectories:
  - Structure: `social-media-post/[blog-post-name]/`
  - Example: `social-media-post/cilium-troubleshooting-2025/`
  - Include platform-specific files (e.g., `bluesky.md`, `linkedin.md`)
- When updating URLs in social media posts, use direct paths to blog posts:
  - Correct: `https://support.tools/post/cilium-troubleshooting-2025/`
  - Incorrect: `https://support.tools/post/cilium-troubleshooting/cilium-troubleshooting-2025/`

## Link Management
- Links between blog posts should use relative paths
- When referencing the original post in an update, use the format `../original-post-name`
- For external resources, use absolute URLs

## Memory Bank Updates
- When creating a new blog post, update all relevant memory bank files
- Pay special attention to `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to reflect the new content
- Follow the established content organization pattern documented here
