Let's explore a C source code snippet that accomplishes the task.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h>

int main()
{
    char buffer[4096];
    DWORD cb = 4096;

    INTERNET_CACHE_ENTRY_INFO *p = (INTERNET_CACHE_ENTRY_INFO *)buffer;
    HANDLE h = FindFirstUrlCacheEntry(NULL, p, &cb);
    while (h)
    {
        // Do something with it...
        printf("Deleting: %s...", p->lpszSourceUrlName);
        if (!DeleteUrlCacheEntry(p->lpszSourceUrlName))
        {
            printf("failed, 0x%x
", GetLastError());
        }
        else
            printf("ok
");

        cb = 4096;
        if (!FindNextUrlCacheEntry(h, (INTERNET_CACHE_ENTRY_INFO *)buffer, &cb))
            break;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

By utilizing the provided C code, you can achieve automated deletion of Internet Explorer cache entries, enhancing your cache management practices efficiently and effectively.
