# [Installing 'robot-detect' to Check for The ROBOT Attack](#installing-robot-detect-to-check-for-the-robot-attack)

In this guide, we'll cover how to install and run the 'robot-detect' script on Linux Mint 18.3 to check for vulnerabilities related to The ROBOT Attack.

## [Installing Python3](#installing-python3)

First, ensure you have Python3 installed on your system:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev
```

## [Setting Up Python3 with Virtualenv](#setting-up-python3-with-virtualenv)

Next, we'll set up Python3 in a virtual environment:

```bash
# Installs to $HOME/.local
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade virtualenv

PYTHON_VERSION=$(python3 -c 'import platform; print(platform.python_version())')

# I have a habit of using a 'direnv'-compatible layout.
virtualenv -p python3 .direnv/python-$PYTHON_VERSION
source ./.direnv/python-$PYTHON_VERSION/bin/activate
```

## [Installing Required Python Packages](#installing-required-python-packages)

With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install gmpy2
pip install cryptography
```

## [Installing 'robot-detect'](#installing-robot-detect)

Download and set up the 'robot-detect' script:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robotattackorg/robot-detect/master/robot-detect
chmod +x robot-detect
```

## [Running 'robot-detect'](#running-robot-detect)

Finally, run the 'robot-detect' script to check for vulnerabilities:

```bash
./robot-detect example.com
```

By following these steps, you can efficiently install and run the 'robot-detect' script to ensure your systems are protected against The ROBOT Attack.
