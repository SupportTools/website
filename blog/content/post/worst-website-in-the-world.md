## It Started with VMware

## Registration: A Kafkaesque Journey

Creating an account was my first hurdle. Between outdated CAPTCHA systems, dead-end chatbot links, and password policies that blocked modern tools like 1Password, I began to suspect this site was designed to test my patience.

## The Portal Maze

Once inside, I faced a labyrinth of misdirection:

- **The Search Bar:** Typing "VMware" yielded nothing but unrelated CVEs.
- **My Downloads:** Initially empty, it magically populated after clicking a dozen unrelated links.
- **Entitlements:** A cryptic page full of broken links that promised access but delivered nothing.

Broadcom's solution to every frustration? Redirect me to their main page with a shrug.

## Conclusion

Broadcom's support portal is more than just a bad website—it's a masterclass in user hostility. If Broadcom hates its users this much, why bother maintaining a support site at all? A Shopify page would be infinitely more functional.
