Backing up your Kubernetes cluster is critical for disaster recovery and operational continuity. **KubeBackup** is a tool designed to simplify cluster backups by **exporting YAML configurations** and **uploading them to an S3 bucket**. With KubeBackup, you can automate backups, ensuring you have all necessary data to redeploy or restore your cluster quickly.

## What is KubeBackup?

KubeBackup automates the process of **backing up your Kubernetes cluster** by accessing the **Kubernetes API** to export YAML files for every cluster and namespace resource. These backups are **compressed and uploaded to an S3 bucket**, making it easy to restore or redeploy your environment in case of an issue.

---

## How KubeBackup Works

- **YAML Export**: The tool connects to your cluster using in-cluster credentials or a provided kubeconfig file.
- **Directory Structure**:  
  - Namespace-scoped objects: `namespace-scoped/<namespace>/<object>`  
  - Cluster-scoped objects: `cluster-scoped/<object>`
- **S3 Upload**: All exported YAML files are compressed and uploaded to your **S3 bucket** for safekeeping.

This ensures that you have a complete, well-organized backup of all Kubernetes objects.

---

## Installation and Setup  

To install or upgrade **KubeBackup**, use the **Helm chart**:

```bash
helm repo add SupportTools https://charts.support.tools
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install kubebackup SupportTools/kubebackup \
  --set s3.region="us-east-2" \
  --set s3.bucket="my-bucket" \
  --set s3.folder="my-cluster" \
  --set s3.accessKey="S3_ACCESS_KEY_GOES_HERE" \
  --set s3.secretKey="S3_SECRET_KEY_GOES_HERE"
```

This command deploys a **KubeBackup pod** that connects to the Kubernetes API, exports YAML files, and uploads them to the specified **S3 bucket**.

## Configuration Options

| Parameter         | Description         | Default             |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| `image.repository` | Image repository | `cube8021/kubebackup` |
| `image.tag`        | Image tag        | `v1.1.0`            |
| `image.pullPolicy` | Image pull policy | `IfNotPresent`      |
| `s3.region`        | AWS Region       | `us-east-2`         |
| `s3.bucket`        | S3 Bucket        | `kubebackup`        |

These options give you flexibility in configuring the backup process to match your environment.

## Building KubeBackup from Source

If you prefer to build **KubeBackup** from source, ensure that **Go** and **Docker** are installed. Then, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattmattox/kubebackup
cd kubebackup
make build
```

This will create the KubeBackup binary, ready to be deployed.

---

## Why Use KubeBackup?

1. **Automated Backups**: Ensure backups run regularly with minimal manual intervention.
2. **Off-Cluster Storage**: Upload backups to **S3** to protect against cluster failures.
3. **Quick Restores**: Use YAML exports to redeploy resources quickly.
4. **Structured Data**: Organizes backups by **namespace** and **cluster scope** for easy management.
5. **Open Source**: KubeBackup is **open-source** and **community-driven**, ensuring ongoing support and updates.
6. **Object Restoration**: Restore individual objects or entire namespaces with ease without needing to restore the entire cluster.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Automate Backups**: Use **cron jobs** or automation pipelines to schedule regular backups.
2. **Encrypt Data**: Secure sensitive backups with encryption tools.
3. **Test Restores**: Regularly verify that your backups can be restored successfully.
4. **Monitor Backups**: Use tools like **Prometheus** to track backup success rates and detect issues.

---

## Conclusion

KubeBackup is an essential tool for maintaining **disaster recovery readiness** in Kubernetes environments. With automated YAML exports and seamless S3 uploads, KubeBackup ensures that youâ€™re always prepared for potential failures. Install it today using Helm and start safeguarding your cluster with reliable backups.
