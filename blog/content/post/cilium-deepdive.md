#### [External-to-Pod Communication](#external-to-pod-communication)

Integrating Kubernetes clusters with external networks requires careful consideration of security and routing. We'll examine how Cilium manages ingress traffic, enabling external clients to communicate with services running in pods while implementing security policies and load balancing to protect and optimize these interactions.

```

#### [Explanation and Integration of NodePort](#explanation-and-integration-of-nodeport)

- External Sources: The origin of the request, such as a user or an external system, aiming to communicate with a service inside the Kubernetes cluster.
Internet / External Network: This represents the pathway for communication, traversing the broader Internet or an external network to reach the Kubernetes cluster.
Physical Interface (eth0): The network interface on the Kubernetes node connects to the external world and acts as the gateway for incoming traffic.
Node1 (Node IP: 192.168.101.101/24) is the targeted Kubernetes node that the external traffic reaches. Although the service can be accessed through any node IP, this example focuses on Node1.
- NodePort (e.g., 30000): When a service with the NodePort type is created, Kubernetes opens a high port (30000-32767) on every node. This port forwards traffic to the intended service, regardless of which node it's on. In this example, 30000 is the NodePort that routes traffic to the specific service port of Pod A.
- iptables (For DNAT, to Pod IP: Port): Node's iptables rules translate the destination from the NodePort to the pod's IP and the service's port. This ensures that traffic arriving at the NodePort is correctly forwarded to the pod providing the service.
- CNI (eBPF) in Cilium Pod: Before reaching the pod, traffic is processed by Cilium, which leverages eBPF for efficient packet forwarding, applying network policies, and ensuring security requirements are met.
Veth (Node side) / veth (Pod side): Virtual Ethernet devices that bridge the node's network namespace with that of Pod A, enabling the transfer of network packets to and from the pod.
- Pod A (Pod IP: 10.42.1.1/24, Service Port: 80): The destination pod within the Kubernetes cluster is exposed externally via the NodePort. The service running in the pod listens on a specific port (in this case, 80), which is mapped to the NodePort, allowing external traffic to access it.

#### [Pod-to-External Communication - Default](#pod-to-external-communication-default)

Similarly, pods often need to initiate communication with external services and resources. This section will cover how Cilium handles egress traffic, using eBPF to apply security policies, perform DNS filtering, and route traffic from pods to the external world, ensuring compliance and security.

By comprehensively understanding these data flow mechanisms, Kubernetes administrators and developers can leverage Cilium's advanced networking features to create robust, efficient, and secure applications in cloud-native environments.

```

#### [Explanation and Integration of default Egress traffic](#explanation-and-integration-of-default-egress-traffic)

- Pod A (Pod IP: 10.42.1.1/24): The source pod within the Kubernetes cluster initiating communication to an external destination. The pod is assigned an IP address from the cluster's internal IP range.
Veth (Pod side/Node side): A pair of virtual Ethernet devices connecting the pod's network namespace to the node's network namespace facilitates packet transfer.
- CNI (eBPF) in Cilium Pod: As the packet moves out of the pod, it's processed by Cilium, which uses eBPF to enforce network policies, route the packet, and perform any required modifications. Cilium efficiently handles packet forwarding based on egress policies defined within Kubernetes.
- iptables (For SNAT, to Node IP): To communicate with the outside world, the packet's source IP is translated (SNAT) from the pod's IP to the node's IP address. This translation ensures that responses from the external destination can be routed back to the correct pod.
- Node1 (Node IP: 192.168.101.101/24): This is the Kubernetes node that routes the packet from Pod A to the external network. The node's IP address is the source IP for the egress traffic following SNAT.
- Physical Interface (eth0): The network interface on Node1 that connects the Kubernetes cluster to the external network, serving as the gateway for outbound traffic.
Internet / External Network: This represents the broader Internet or an external network that the packet traverses to reach the specified external destination.
- External Destination (IP: 203.0.113.5): The target of the outbound communication from Pod A. This could be any service or server outside the Kubernetes cluster that Pod A needs to interact with, identified by its IP address.

#### [Pod-to-External Communication - Egress Gateway](#pod-to-external-communication-egress-gateway)

To implement an egress policy using Cilium and manage traffic flow, including Source NAT (SNAT), to change the source IP and ensure the traffic correctly flows back to the originating pod, you can define CiliumNetworkPolicies (CNPs). These policies allow you to specify egress rules for pods, including which egress endpoints pods can communicate with, and apply SNAT to outbound traffic to mask the pod IPs with the egress gateway's IP.

Here's an example YAML definition for a CiliumNetworkPolicy that applies an egress policy with SNAT for Pod-to-External communication through an egress gateway:

```yaml
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: egress-snat-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myApp
  egress:
  - toEndpoints:
    - matchLabels:
        app: externalService
    toCIDR:
    - "0.0.0.0/0"
    egressGateway:
    - ip: "192.168.101.100"
  - toCIDR:
    - "0.0.0.0/0"
    egressGateway:
    - ip: "192.168.101.100"
```

#### [Explanation of the YAML](#explanation-of-the-yaml)

- `apiVersion`: Specifies the API version for CiliumNetworkPolicy.
- `kind`: The kind of Kubernetes object, in this case, CiliumNetworkPolicy.
- `metadata`: Metadata about the CNP, including its name and namespace.
- `spec`: The specification of the policy.
  - `endpointSelector`: Selector for the endpoints (pods) the policy applies to. In this example, it selects pods with the label `app: myApp`.
  - `egress`: Defines the rules for egress traffic from the selected pods.
    - `toEndpoints`: (Optional) Specifies the endpoints (within the cluster) that the selected pods can communicate with.
    - `toCIDR`: Specifies the IP addresses/ranges outside the cluster with which the selected pods can communicate. Here, it allows communication to `203.0.113.5`.
    - `egressGateway`: Specifies the IP of the egress gateway through which the traffic should be routed. This gateway will apply SNAT to the traffic.
  - `toCIDR`: Specifies broader access to any IP address, directing all other traffic through the egress gateway.

#### [How the Source IP is Changed and Traffic Flows Back](#how-the-source-ip-is-changed-and-traffic-flows-back)

1. **Outbound Traffic**: The Cilium egress policy is applied when a pod (matching `app: myApp`) sends traffic to the external IP `203.0.113.5`. The traffic is directed to the egress gateway specified by `ip: "192.168.101.100"`.

2. **SNAT at Egress Gateway**: The egress gateway modifies the source IP of the outbound packets from the pod's IP to the gateway's IP (`192.168.101.100`). This masks the internal source IP and presents the gateway's IP as the source of the external service.

3. **Inbound Traffic**: When the external service responds, it sends the traffic to the source IP it knows, which is the egress gateway's IP.

4. **Reverse NAT (DNAT) at Egress Gateway**: Upon receiving the response, the egress gateway performs the reverse NAT operation, changing the destination IP from its IP to the original pod's IP based on the connection tracking tables it maintains.

5. **Traffic Delivery to Pod**: The response traffic is routed back to the originating pod inside the cluster, completing the communication loop.

Administrators can effectively manage and secure pod egress traffic by utilizing Cilium's egress policy with SNAT through an egress gateway. This ensures compliance with network policies and seamless communication with external services.
