Working with RAID controllers can be a daunting task, especially if you only need to do it occasionally. MegaCLI, a powerful command-line tool for managing RAID controllers and disks, can be particularly challenging due to its cryptic syntax. To simplify the process, Iâ€™ve compiled this cheat sheet of essential MegaCLI commands and tips for easy reference.

## Installing MegaCLI  

To install MegaCLI on a Debian-based system, use:  

```bash
sudo apt-get install megacli
```

---

## Common Parameters  

### Controller Syntax: `-aN`  
- Use this to specify the adapter ID.  
- Avoid using the `ALL` flag to prevent accidental changes across all controllers.

### Physical Drive: `-PhysDrv [E:S]`  
- `E`: Enclosure ID  
- `S`: Slot number (starting at 0).  
- Retrieve enclosure and slot information with:  

```bash
megacli -EncInfo -aALL
```

### Virtual Drive: `-Lx`  
- Use to specify the virtual drive where `x` is a number starting at 0 or the string `all`.

## Information Commands  

### Get Controller Information  

- Display adapter details:  
  ```bash
  megacli -AdpAllInfo -aALL
  ```  
- Show RAID configuration:  
  ```bash
  megacli -CfgDsply -aALL
  ```  
- Export event logs:  
  ```bash
  megacli -adpeventlog -getevents -f lsi-events.log -a0 -nolog
  ```

## Common Operations  

### Replace a Drive  

1. Set the drive offline:  
   ```bash
   megacli -PDOffline -PhysDrv[E:S] -aN
   ```
2. Mark the drive as missing:  
   ```bash
   megacli -PDMarkMissing -PhysDrv [E:S] -aN
   ```
3. Prepare for removal:  
   ```bash
   megacli -PDPrpRmv -PhysDrv [E:S] -aN
   ```
4. Replace the drive and assign it:  
   ```bash
   megacli -PdReplaceMissing -PhysDrv[E:S] -ArrayN -rowN -aN
   ```
5. Start the rebuild process:  
   ```bash
   megacli -PDRbld -Start -PhysDrv [E:S] -aN
   ```

### Fix a "Foreign" Drive  

- Mark the drive as good:  
  ```bash
  megacli -PDMakeGood -PhysDrv [E:S] -aALL
  ```  
- Clear the foreign configuration:  
  ```bash
  megacli -CfgForeign -Clear -aALL
  ```

### Disable the Alarm  

If the alarm is causing unnecessary noise, turn it off:  

```bash
megacli -AdpSetProp AlarmDsbl -aALL
```
