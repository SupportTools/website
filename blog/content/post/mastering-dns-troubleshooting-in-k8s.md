## [Introduction to DNS in Kubernetes](#introduction)

A brief introduction to DNS and its role in Kubernetes. We'll also discuss the importance of DNS in Kubernetes and how it differs from traditional DNS solutions.

## [Overview](#overview)

We'll start by understanding the role and significance of DNS in Kubernetes. DNS is crucial for service discovery and connectivity within a Kubernetes cluster.

### [CoreDNS and Kubernetes DNS Service](#coredns-and-kubernetes-dns-service)

A brief introduction to CoreDNS, the default DNS server used in Kubernetes, and how it differs from traditional DNS solutions. We'll also touch upon the Kubernetes DNS service, which translates service and pod names into IP addresses.

- Hands-on experience in customizing CoreDNS settings.

### [Network Policies and DNS](#network-policies)

Understand how Kubernetes network policies can impact DNS resolution and learn strategies to configure them for optimal DNS functionality.

**Example Command**: `kubectl describe netpol <policy-name>` - To examine a network policy affecting DNS.

**Diagram Suggestion**: Visual representation of how network policies can block or allow DNS traffic in a Kubernetes cluster.

### [Key Takeaways](#key-takeaways-network-policies)

- Insights into the interaction between network policies and DNS.
- Strategies for configuring network policies to support DNS operations.

## [Lab Exercises](#lab-exercises)

Hands-on lab exercises to reinforce the concepts covered in the workshop.

### [Lab 1: Pod DNS Resolution](#lab-1)

#### [Lab 1.0: Setup](#lab-1-0)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dns-troubleshoot-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: swiss-army-knife
    image: rancherlab/swiss-army-knife
    command:
      - sleep
      - "3600"
  dnsPolicy: Broken
```

#### [Lab 1.1: Debug](#lab-1-1)

Can the pod resolve the service name?

**Example Command**: `kubectl exec dns-troubleshoot-pod -- nslookup kubernetes.default` - To test DNS resolution inside a pod.

Can the pod resolve an external domain name?

**Example Command**: `kubectl exec dns-troubleshoot-pod -- nslookup google.com` - To test DNS resolution inside a pod.

What IP address is the pod using for DNS resolution?

**Example Command**: `kubectl exec dns-troubleshoot-pod -- cat /etc/resolv.conf` - To view the DNS configuration inside a pod.

#### [Lab 1.2: Fix](#lab-1-2)

Modify the pod's DNS configuration to use a custom DNS server.

        }
        cache {
            success 512 30  # Caching successful responses
            denial 512 5   # Caching denial responses
