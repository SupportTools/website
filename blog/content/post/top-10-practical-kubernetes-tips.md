# 10 Practical Tips to Tame Kubernetes in Production

After working with Kubernetes across hundreds of cluster deployments, I've collected these practical tips that address common pain points and can significantly improve your Kubernetes experience.

## Tip 1: Implement Proper Resource Requests and Limits

One of the most common issues in Kubernetes environments is improper resource allocation. Without proper requests and limits, you might face:

- Node resource exhaustion
- Unpredictable application performance
- Evicted pods during high load

**Practical implementation:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: resource-optimized-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: myapp:1.0
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "100m"
      limits:
        memory: "256Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
```

**Pro tip:** Start by profiling your applications with tools like Prometheus and Grafana to understand their actual resource needs before setting requests and limits.

## Tip 2: Master kubectl Debug Techniques

Debug production issues efficiently with these kubectl commands:

```bash
# Quick pod inspection
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# Live logs following
kubectl logs -f <pod-name> -c <container-name>

# Direct container execution
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh

# Port forwarding for local testing
kubectl port-forward <pod-name> 8080:80

# Ephemeral debug containers (K8s 1.18+)
kubectl debug -it <pod-name> --image=busybox --target=<container-name>
```

**Pro tip:** Create a set of debug container images with common troubleshooting tools pre-installed for your environment.

## Tip 3: Implement Automated Certificate Management

Manual TLS certificate management is tedious and error-prone. Implement cert-manager to automate certificate lifecycle:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: example-cert
  namespace: default
spec:
  secretName: example-tls
  duration: 2160h # 90 days
  renewBefore: 360h # 15 days
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt-prod
    kind: ClusterIssuer
  dnsNames:
  - example.com
  - www.example.com
```

**Pro tip:** Set up alerts for certificate expiration that trigger at least 2 weeks before expiry to provide ample remediation time.

## Tip 4: Leverage Node Affinities and Taints for Workload Distribution

Control workload placement with Node Affinity and Taints:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-workload
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: node-type
            operator: In
            values:
            - gpu
  tolerations:
  - key: "dedicated"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "gpu" 
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  containers:
  - name: gpu-container
    image: gpu-workload:1.0
```

**Pro tip:** Create dedicated node pools for specialized workloads (database, GPU, CPU-intensive) and use taints to ensure only appropriate workloads land on these nodes.

## Tip 5: Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling Based on Custom Metrics

Go beyond CPU/memory-based autoscaling with custom metrics:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: queue-processor-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: queue-processor
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: External
    external:
      metric:
        name: rabbitmq_queue_length
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            queue: orders
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: 100
```

**Pro tip:** Implement the Prometheus Adapter to expose application-specific metrics that better reflect your workload needs than simple CPU usage.

## Tip 6: Implement Proper Pod Disruption Budgets

Protect service availability during voluntary disruptions:

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: api-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2  # or use maxUnavailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: api
```

**Pro tip:** Always test your PDBs by draining a node and watching how the cluster responds. Many teams implement PDBs but never validate their effectiveness.

## Tip 7: Optimize etcd Performance

etcd is the heart of Kubernetes. These practices can help maintain its health:

1. Use dedicated SSD storage with high IOPS
2. Keep etcd database size under 8GB
3. Implement regular etcd backups and test restoration
4. Set appropriate resource limits for etcd pods
5. Monitor etcd metrics with Prometheus

**Pro tip:** Periodically test etcd backup restoration procedures to ensure they actually work when needed.

## Tip 8: Implement Network Policies for Security

Secure your cluster with proper network segmentation:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-netpol
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: database
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: api
    ports:
    - port: 5432
```

**Pro tip:** Begin with a default "deny all" policy and then selectively open communication paths as needed. This is more secure than the default "allow all" approach.

## Tip 9: Use Admission Controllers for Policy Enforcement

Implement policy guardrails with admission controllers like OPA Gatekeeper:

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1
kind: ConstraintTemplate
metadata:
  name: requirelabels
spec:
  crd:
    spec:
      names:
        kind: RequireLabels
      validation:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          properties:
            labels:
              type: array
              items:
                type: string
  targets:
    - target: admission.k8s.gatekeeper.sh
      rego: |
        package requirelabels
        violation[{"msg": msg}] {
          provided := {label | input.review.object.metadata.labels[label]}
          required := {label | label := input.parameters.labels[_]}
          missing := required - provided
          count(missing) > 0
          msg := sprintf("Missing required labels: %v", [missing])
        }
```

**Pro tip:** Start with audit-only mode when implementing policies to understand impact before enforcing.

## Tip 10: Design Resilient Deployments with Pod Topology Spread Constraints

Ensure high availability by distributing pods across failure domains:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: highly-available-app
spec:
  replicas: 6
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: high-availability
    spec:
      topologySpreadConstraints:
      - maxSkew: 1
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
        whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: high-availability
      - maxSkew: 1
        topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
        whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: high-availability
```

**Pro tip:** Combine topology spread with pod anti-affinity rules for critical workloads to maximize resilience against infrastructure failures.
