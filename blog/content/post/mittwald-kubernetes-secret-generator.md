# [Introduction: Simplify Kubernetes Secret Management](#introduction)

Managing secrets securely in a Kubernetes cluster is crucial yet challenging. From API keys to database credentials, ensuring these secrets are handled properly can be a time-consuming task. The **Mittwald Kubernetes Secret Generator** offers an elegant solution: an operator that automates secret creation and lifecycle management, reducing human error and saving time.

In this post, we'll cover everything you need to start using the Secret Generator, including installation, configuration, and advanced use cases.

# [Prerequisites: Setting Up for Success](#prerequisites)

Before diving in, ensure you have the following ready:
- An operational Kubernetes cluster (minikube or managed clusters like EKS/GKE/AKS work fine).
- `kubectl` configured to interact with your cluster.
- Helm package manager installed on your system. If not, follow [this Helm installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

# [Installing the Mittwald Kubernetes Secret Generator](#installing-the-mittwald-kubernetes-secret-generator)

You can install the Mittwald Kubernetes Secret Generator using Helm. Follow these steps:

1. Add the Mittwald Helm chart repository:

    ```bash
    helm repo add mittwald https://helm.mittwald.de
    ```

2. Update your Helm chart repository to fetch the latest charts:

    ```bash
    helm repo update
    ```

3. Install the Kubernetes Secret Generator in your cluster:

    ```bash
    helm install secret-generator mittwald/kubernetes-secret-generator
    ```

Once installed, the operator will monitor for secrets annotated for generation.

# [Using the Mittwald Kubernetes Secret Generator](#using-the-mittwald-kubernetes-secret-generator)

To automate secret creation, annotate your Secret resource with `secret-generator.v1.mittwald.de/autogenerate`. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

## [Example 1: Generating a Password Secret](#example-1-generating-a-password-secret)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-credentials
  annotations:
    secret-generator.v1.mittwald.de/autogenerate: "password"
type: Opaque
```

This configuration automatically generates a random password and stores it as a secret.

## [Example 2: Multiple Keys](#example-2-multiple-keys)

You can generate multiple keys in a single secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: multi-key-secret
  annotations:
    secret-generator.v1.mittwald.de/autogenerate: |
      password
      apiKey
type: Opaque
```

In this example, two keys (`password` and `apiKey`) will be generated.

## [Example 3: Customizing Key Names](#example-3-customizing-key-names)

You can specify custom key names and override default behavior:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: custom-secret
  annotations:
    secret-generator.v1.mittwald.de/autogenerate: |
      db_password=password
      service_token=token
type: Opaque
```

Here, the keys `db_password` and `service_token` will be generated with random values.

# [Advanced Usage: Enhanced Configuration](#advanced-usage-enhanced-configuration)

The Mittwald Secret Generator supports advanced configurations, such as:
- **String length customization:** Control the length of generated values.
- **Base64 encoding:** Automatically encode sensitive values.
- **Custom generators:** Use your own logic for specific keys.

For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: advanced-secret
  annotations:
    secret-generator.v1.mittwald.de/autogenerate: |
      password,length=20
      apiKey,base64
type: Opaque
```

In this configuration, the `password` will have 20 characters, and `apiKey` will be base64-encoded.

# [Troubleshooting Common Issues](#troubleshooting-common-issues)

1. **Secrets not being generated:** Ensure the operator is running by checking its pod status:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n mittwald
    ```
2. **Permissions errors:** Verify that the operator has the correct Role and RoleBinding to manage secrets.

# [Conclusion: Streamline Kubernetes Secret Management](#conclusion)

The **Mittwald Kubernetes Secret Generator** is a game-changer for Kubernetes users, simplifying secret management while enhancing security. By automating secret generation, you reduce manual intervention and ensure your secrets are always secure and up to date. 

Start using the Mittwald Secret Generator today to take your Kubernetes secret management to the next level!
