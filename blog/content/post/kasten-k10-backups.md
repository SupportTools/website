Kubernetes environments require **robust backups and disaster recovery tools** to protect against failures, misconfigurations, and outages. **Kasten K10** provides an enterprise-grade solution for **backing up, restoring, and migrating Kubernetes applications**, ensuring that both **stateful** and **stateless** workloads are safeguarded.

In this post, weâ€™ll explore the features, installation process, and best practices for **Kasten K10**, making it easy for you to adopt it as part of your Kubernetes backup strategy.

---

## Why Use Kasten K10?  

Kasten K10 is designed to address the backup and recovery needs of modern **stateful applications** in Kubernetes. It offers:
- **Application-aware backups**: Automatically detects applications and backs up their data.
- **Disaster recovery**: Restore workloads and state across clusters.
- **Mobility**: Easily migrate applications between clusters or cloud providers.
- **Policy-based management**: Automate backup schedules with policies.
- **Ransomware protection**: Detect and mitigate data breaches with built-in security features.

---

## Installing Kasten K10  

The **K10 platform** is deployed via **Helm** and integrates with multiple storage solutions, including **S3-compatible storage**, **Azure Blob**, and **GCP storage**.

### 1. Add the K10 Helm Repository  

```bash
helm repo add kasten https://charts.kasten.io
helm repo update
```

### 2. Install K10 in Your Cluster  

```bash
helm install k10 kasten/k10 --namespace k10 --create-namespace
```

This command deploys the **K10 UI, policy engine, and backup controllers**. Once deployed, you can access the K10 dashboard via a Kubernetes service.

---

## Configuring Backup Policies  

K10 allows you to define **policies** that automate backups and restores. Policies can be scheduled to run at specific intervals to ensure consistent backups.

```yaml
apiVersion: config.kio.kasten.io/v1alpha1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: daily-backup
spec:
  frequency: "@daily"
  actions:
    - type: Backup
      target: s3://my-kasten-backups
```

With Kasten K10, you can also specify **backup retention** policies, ensuring old backups are cleaned up automatically.

---

## Performing Backups with K10  

Once installed, you can initiate a backup via the **K10 UI** or **kubectl**:

```bash
kubectl k10 create backup --namespace my-app --target s3://my-backups
```

This will back up the **application state, PVCs, and configurations** and store them in the specified S3 bucket.

---

## Restoring Applications with K10  

Restoring an application is as simple as selecting the **backup from the K10 UI** or using the CLI:

```bash
kubectl k10 restore backup --backup-name my-app-backup --namespace restored-app
```

Kasten K10 will automatically recreate the workloads and persistent volumes based on the backup.

---

## K10 Multi-Cloud Mobility  

One of the standout features of **Kasten K10** is **application mobility**. You can use K10 to **migrate applications between clusters** or **move workloads between cloud providers**.

```bash
kubectl k10 migrate backup --backup-name my-app-backup --target-cluster my-new-cluster
```

This makes K10 an excellent solution for **disaster recovery and cloud portability**.

---

## Monitoring Backups and Compliance  

Kasten K10 integrates with **Prometheus** to monitor backup health and trigger alerts if something goes wrong. Use **AlertManager** to receive **Slack or email notifications** for failed backups or policy violations.

---

## Security and Ransomware Protection  

K10 offers built-in **encryption and immutability** to protect backups from tampering or ransomware attacks. You can configure **role-based access control (RBAC)** policies to ensure only authorized users have access to critical backups.

---

## Best Practices for K10 Backups  

1. **Automate Backup Policies**: Define and schedule regular backups to avoid manual intervention.
2. **Test Restores Regularly**: Ensure that your restore process works as expected to avoid surprises in production.
3. **Offload Backups to Cloud Storage**: Store backups offsite in **S3, Azure, or GCP** to protect against on-prem failures.
4. **Monitor Backup Health**: Use **Prometheus** and **AlertManager** to detect failed backups or policy breaches.
5. **Use Encryption and Immutability**: Secure your backups with encryption and prevent tampering with immutability settings.
