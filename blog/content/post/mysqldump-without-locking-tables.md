Creating backups with `mysqldump` is a common practice, but by default, it locks all tables, limiting write operations during the process. This guide will show you how to avoid locking tables while ensuring consistent backups for **MySQL** and **MariaDB** databases.

## The Default Behavior of `mysqldump`  

By default, `mysqldump` locks all tables during the backup process to ensure data consistency. While this is effective for maintaining a stable snapshot, it restricts the database to read-only mode, disrupting applications that require write access during the backup.

---

## Why Are All Tables Locked?  

The default table-locking behavior is necessary for **MyISAM** tables because they lack transactional support. **InnoDB**, on the other hand, supports transactions and ensures data consistency without requiring table locks.  

Since **MySQL 5.5.5** (released in 2010), InnoDB has been the default storage engine, and it is recommended for most use cases due to its robust transaction support.

## How to Avoid Locking Tables  

To avoid table locking during backups, use the `--single-transaction` and `--skip-lock-tables` flags with `mysqldump`. These options work as follows:  

- **`--single-transaction`**: Wraps the dump process in a transaction, ensuring data consistency for InnoDB tables.  
- **`--skip-lock-tables`**: Prevents `mysqldump` from applying the default table locks.  

### Example Commands:

#### Backup a Single Database Without Locking Tables:
```bash
mysqldump --single-transaction --skip-lock-tables my_database > my_database.sql
```

#### Backup Multiple Databases Without Locking Tables:
```bash
mysqldump --single-transaction --skip-lock-tables --databases my_db1 my_db2 > my_database.sql
```

#### Backup All Databases Without Locking Tables:
```bash
mysqldump --single-transaction --skip-lock-tables --all-databases > my_database.sql
```

## Important Notes  

### Mixed Storage Engines:
If your database includes both **InnoDB** and **MyISAM** tables:
- Using `--single-transaction` and `--skip-lock-tables` can leave **MyISAM** tables in an inconsistent state since it does not lock read/write operations for these tables.  
- For environments with mixed engines, consider using table locks or migrating **MyISAM** tables to **InnoDB**.  

### Compatibility:
These options are compatible with both **MySQL** and **MariaDB**, ensuring flexibility across database systems.

## Conclusion  

Using `mysqldump` with `--single-transaction` and `--skip-lock-tables` is a highly effective method to create consistent backups without disrupting write operations. This approach works seamlessly for **InnoDB** tables, but itâ€™s important to review your storage engine configuration when applying this method.

By incorporating these flags, you can maintain database availability during backups, making it a practical solution for modern applications.
