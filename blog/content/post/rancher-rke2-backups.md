# “No One Has Ever Gotten Fired for Having Too Many Backups”

When running **Rancher** or **RKE2**, there’s one mantra to live by: **“Always back it up before making a change.”** Backups are not just about recovering from disasters—they’re about giving you the confidence to experiment, upgrade, and troubleshoot without fear. This post covers essential strategies for **Kubernetes backups**, with practical advice and links to tools and methods to make backup processes effortless.

## Why Kubernetes Backups are Critical  
In dynamic environments like **Rancher** or **RKE2 clusters**, backups are essential for several reasons:
- **Recover from Failures:** Accidental deletions, misconfigurations, or system failures are common in large deployments.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Ensures quick recovery from hardware failures, node outages, or security incidents.
- **Simplifies Upgrades:** Upgrades are smoother when you know you have working backups in place.
- **Experiment Safely:** With reliable backups, you can make configuration changes without fear.

## Etcd Backups: Quick and Simple  

Etcd stores the **state** of your entire Kubernetes cluster, including workloads, configurations, and networking details. Thankfully, taking an etcd snapshot is quick and easy:

```bash
rke2 etcd-snapshot save --name snapshot-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

When making **any major change**, such as upgrading the control plane or modifying critical resources, **always take a snapshot** first. Remember: **“Better safe than sorry.”**

Restoring an etcd snapshot is just as straightforward:

```bash
rke2 etcd-snapshot restore --name snapshot-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

For more on working with **etcd snapshots**, see [our post on backup tools](https://support.tools/kubernetes-backup-tools/).

## YAML Exports: Your Best Friend Before Any Change  

Another essential practice is **exporting Kubernetes objects to YAML** before editing them. With this approach, you can easily **roll back** if something goes wrong.

```bash
kubectl get deployment my-app -n my-namespace -o yaml > my-app-backup.yaml
```

If you need to revert to the previous version:

```bash
kubectl apply -f my-app-backup.yaml
```

This small habit will save you from countless headaches when making on-the-fly changes. For a deeper dive into YAML-based backups, check out [my post on KubeBackup](https://support.tools/kubebackup/).

## Automating Backups with Tools  

To ensure backups are **consistent and automated**, use tools like **Velero, Longhorn**, and **KubeBackup**:

- **[Velero](https://support.tools/backup-kubernetes-cluster-aws-s3-velero/):**  
  Great for **application-level backups** and **cluster migrations**. Works well with S3-compatible storage.
  
- **[Longhorn](https://support.tools/longhorn-backups/):**  
  A **distributed block storage system** that excels at **PVC snapshots** and volume backups.

- **[KubeBackup](https://support.tools/kubebackup/):**  
  Automates **YAML exports** of Kubernetes resources and **uploads them to S3**. Ideal for maintaining configuration backups over time.

- **[Kasten K10](https://support.tools/kasten-k10/):**  
  A **data management platform** that provides **backup, disaster recovery, and mobility** for Kubernetes applications.

- **[Rancher Backup Operator](https://support.tools/post/backup-rancher-and-its-clusters/):**  
  A **Rancher-native backup solution** that automates backups of Rancher.

With these tools in place, you can automate backups to run on schedules, offload them to **S3 or cloud storage**, and rest easy knowing your cluster is safe.

## Backup Best Practices  

1. **Backup Before Every Change:**  
   Whether it’s upgrading Rancher, changing cluster configurations, or modifying resources—**always take a backup first**.

2. **Use Multiple Backup Methods:**  
   Combine **etcd snapshots**, **YAML exports**, and **Velero/Longhorn backups** to ensure you’re covered on all fronts. Remember, **“No one has ever gotten fired for having too many backups.”**

3. **Offsite Storage:**  
   Always **upload backups to an external location**, such as **S3**, to protect against hardware failures or catastrophic events.

4. **Test Your Restores:**  
   A backup is only as good as your ability to restore it. Regularly **test your restore processes** to avoid surprises during real emergencies.

5. **Monitor Your Backups:**  
   Use **Prometheus** and **AlertManager** to monitor backup health and ensure your backups are being created on schedule.

## Conclusion  

Running Kubernetes with **Rancher** or **RKE2** requires you to be proactive about **backups**. Whether it’s an etcd snapshot, a YAML export, or an automated backup using **Velero, Longhorn**, or **KubeBackup**, the key is to **always have a backup before making a change**. With these strategies and tools in place, you can ensure smooth operations, quick recoveries, and peace of mind.
