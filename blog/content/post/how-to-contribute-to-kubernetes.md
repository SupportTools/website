# How to Contribute to Kubernetes: A Guide for Beginners

Are you eager to dip your toes into the world of Kubernetes but feeling a bit overwhelmed by the sheer volume of codebases and opportunities for improvement? Fear not, as a Kubernetes Specialist, I am here to guide you through the process of contributing to this dynamic community.

KubeCon + CloudNativeCon has been hosting new contributor workshops around the globe, with upcoming events in Barcelona and Shanghai. These workshops are designed to cater to individuals with varying levels of experience in open source and Kubernetes. Whether you are a complete newbie or a seasoned developer looking to dive into the Kubernetes ecosystem, there's something for everyone.

## What to Expect at the Workshops

The workshops are structured to provide a hands-on learning experience tailored to your comfort level with open source and Kubernetes. In the 101 track, newcomers will receive developer setup and project workflow support, along with their very own first issue to work on. For those in the 201 track, there will be a codebase walkthrough and demonstrations on local development and testing.

Beyond just coding, the workshops will also cover the basics of project structure, community interaction, and where to seek help when needed. Because contributions to Kubernetes are not solely technical, participants will have the opportunity to explore different avenues of involvement within the community.

## Mentoring and Networking

New contributors will have the chance to engage with current community members, explore different Special Interest Groups (SIGs), and potentially find mentors to guide them on their journey. Additionally, mentoring sessions will be available during the workshops for further assistance and guidance.

## Success Stories and Testimonials

Previous workshop attendees, such as Vallery Lancy, an Engineer at Lyft, have shared their positive experiences and insights gained from participating in these events. These workshops serve as a platform for individuals like Vallery to jump-start their contributions to Kubernetes and forge connections with seasoned professionals in the field.
