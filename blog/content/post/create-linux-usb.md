## Section 1: Introduction  
Creating a bootable USB drive is an essential task when installing or running Linux distributions. The `dd` command is a powerful tool for this purpose, offering simplicity and flexibility.

## Section 2: Prerequisites  
- A USB drive with sufficient capacity for the Linux ISO.
- A Linux ISO file of your desired distribution.
- Basic familiarity with the Linux terminal.

## Section 3: Steps  
1. **Identify the USB Drive**  
   Use the `lsblk` or `fdisk -l` command to identify the device name of your USB drive (e.g., `/dev/sdb`).

2. **Backup Data**  
   Ensure you back up any important data on the USB drive, as the process will erase all existing data.

3. **Create the Bootable USB**  
   Run the following command to write the ISO to the USB drive:
   ```bash
   sudo dd if=/path/to/linux.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/linux.iso` with the path to your ISO file and `/dev/sdX` with your USB device.

4. **Verify**  
   Safely eject the USB drive and test it by booting from it.

## Section 4: Conclusion  
The `dd` command is an efficient way to create bootable USB drives. By following these steps, youâ€™ll have a Linux-ready USB drive in minutes!
