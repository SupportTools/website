In this guide, we'll go over the steps to create a swap file on Linux using the `dd` command. Once the swap file is set up, we’ll configure it in `/etc/fstab` so it activates automatically on boot.

### Creating the Swap File

To begin, we'll use the `dd` command to allocate 1GB for the swap file. Then, we’ll format the file, secure its permissions, and activate the swap space.

```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1048576
sudo mkswap /swapfile && sudo chmod 0600 /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

Explanation:

- `if=/dev/zero` initializes the swap file with zeros.
- `of=/swapfile` sets the path for the swap file.
- `bs=1024` and `count=1048576` create a 1GB file.
- `mkswap` formats the file for swap usage, and `chmod 0600` restricts access to root only.
- `swapon` enables the swap file immediately.

### Adding the Swap File to fstab

To make sure the swap file is used after rebooting, add it to the `/etc/fstab` configuration file:

```bash
echo "/swapfile none swap sw 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

This will ensure that the system mounts the swap file on boot.

### Wrapping Up

Forgetting how to do basic tasks like this can happen when you're used to using automation tools like Ansible. However, it's good to know how to set up a swap file manually in case automation isn't available.
