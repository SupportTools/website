Upgrading Kubernetes clusters requires careful planning. While **skipping versions** (e.g., going from 1.28 to 1.30) may seem tempting, it can introduce unexpected issues. This post explains **why sequential upgrades** (1.28 → 1.29 → 1.30) are essential and offers tips for **safe upgrade paths**.

---

## Why Sequential Upgrades Matter

Kubernetes releases new minor versions approximately every **three months**, and each version contains **new features, bug fixes, and deprecations**. Skipping versions may create:

1. **Compatibility Issues:** API resources or features may be removed between versions.
2. **Breakage in Workloads:** Controllers and workloads relying on deprecated APIs could fail.
3. **Unsupported Upgrades:** Kubernetes officially supports upgrades between **adjacent minor versions** only.

---

## Example: Skipping vs. Sequential Upgrades

- **Skipped Upgrade Path**:  
  1.28 → **1.30**  
  *Potential issues: Unsupported APIs removed, changes in CRDs, or storage drivers breaking unexpectedly.*

- **Recommended Path**:  
  1.28 → **1.29** → **1.30**  
  *Sequential upgrades ensure that each change is applied incrementally, minimizing the risk of failures.*

## How to Plan Your Upgrade Path

1. **Review Release Notes:**  
   Carefully read the **release notes** for each version to understand what changes will affect your workloads.

2. **Test in a Staging Environment:**  
   Before upgrading production, apply the upgrade to a **staging cluster** to detect any compatibility issues early.

3. **Use kubeadm or Rancher for Version Management:**  
   Tools like **kubeadm** and **Rancher** simplify version upgrades by ensuring the cluster is upgraded sequentially.

4. **Backup the Cluster:**  
   Always take an **etcd snapshot** and **backup YAML configurations** before upgrading. Refer to [KubeBackup](https://support.tools/kubebackup/) for automated YAML exports.

---

## Sequential Upgrade Process

Here’s a general process for **sequential upgrades** using `kubeadm`:

1. **Upgrade Control Plane to 1.29:**
   ```bash
   kubeadm upgrade apply v1.29.0
   ```

2. **Upgrade Worker Nodes to 1.29:**
   ```bash
   kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets
   kubeadm upgrade node
   kubectl uncordon <node-name>
   ```

3. **Test Workloads on 1.29:**  
   Verify that workloads are running without issues after the 1.29 upgrade.

4. **Proceed to 1.30 Upgrade:**  
   Follow the same process to upgrade to **1.30.0**.

## Best Practices for Kubernetes Upgrades

1. **Always Upgrade Sequentially:**  
   Even if it’s a bit more time-consuming, sequential upgrades (e.g., 1.28 → 1.29 → 1.30) prevent API and workload issues.

2. **Monitor Cluster Health Post-Upgrade:**  
   Use **Prometheus and Grafana** to monitor cluster health and detect any anomalies during the upgrade.

3. **Automate Rollbacks:**  
   If something goes wrong, you should be able to **rollback quickly** using tools like Rancher or backups from **etcd snapshots**.

4. **Coordinate with Application Teams:**  
   Inform your developers of upcoming upgrades to avoid disruptions and ensure their workloads remain compatible.

## Conclusion

Skipping Kubernetes versions may seem like a shortcut, but it introduces unnecessary risks. **Sequential upgrades** ensure smoother transitions by addressing changes incrementally, minimizing workload disruptions, and adhering to **official Kubernetes upgrade policies**. With proper planning and backups, you can upgrade your cluster with confidence.
