# [Linux on Sony Vaio - Connecting an iPod](#linux-on-sony-vaio-connecting-an-ipod)

Matthew Mattox, a Kubernetes Specialist, explores the world of interconnectivity by sharing his preliminary journey of connecting an iPod to a Sony Vaio SRX87 laptop running Linux. 

Sony Vaio laptops, like the SRX87 model, come equipped with a 4-pin Firewire (IEEE1394 or Sony i.Link) port, which can be utilized for connecting various Firewire devices. In this case, Matthew decided to experiment by connecting his iPod to the laptop.

To begin with this experiment, Matthew focused on making his iPod appear as a SCSI block device. This required configuring the kernel with specific options such as enabling Raw IEEE1394 I/O support, SCSI disk support, SCSI generic support, and Macintosh partition map support.

After compiling the kernel with the requisite options and modules, the next steps involved loading modules with commands like `modprobe ohci1394` and `modprobe sbp2`, which are the same commands used for the firewire DVD-ROM drive. These steps aimed to ensure that the iPod was recognized by the system as a direct-access device, as confirmed by checking the `cat /proc/scsi/scsi` output.

Further confirmation of the iPod's recognition was obtained by analyzing the `cat /proc/partitions` output, which displayed information about the partitions on the iPod. This step validated the successful connection and recognition of the iPod as a storage device.

For Linux users interested in exploring additional software options for iPod connectivity, Matthew suggests considering [tex9](http://www.tex9.com/), previously known as xtunes, as a potential solution.

Through these insights, Matthew's experience exemplifies the intricate yet rewarding process of integrating diverse devices into a Linux environment, showcasing the endless possibilities of Linux customization and connectivity.
