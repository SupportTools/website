I’m a Rancher/Kubernetes Principal Support Engineer living near Chicago.

This blog is meant as both a space where I can share the things I am learning as well as somewhere to work on my technical writing skills. I’ll be writing primarily on topics in the field of Rancher, Kubernetes, Docker, VMware, but also expect to cover anything else that interests me.
