## Kubernetes Deep Dive

Learn how Kubernetes works under the hood by exploring key control plane and worker node components in detail. This series covers the **critical elements** of Kubernetes architecture, troubleshooting guides, and best practices.

### Control Plane Components
- [Kube-API Server](/training/kubernetes-deep-dive/kube-apiserver/) - The gateway to Kubernetes, handling all API requests and authentication.
- [Kube Controller Manager](/training/kubernetes-deep-dive/kube-controller-manager/) - Manages controllers that regulate the cluster state.
- [Kube Scheduler](/training/kubernetes-deep-dive/kube-scheduler/) - Assigns workloads to nodes based on resource availability and scheduling policies.
- [etcd](/training/kubernetes-deep-dive/etcd/) - A distributed key-value store for cluster state and configuration.

### Node Components
- [Kubelet](/training/kubernetes-deep-dive/kubelet/) - The agent responsible for managing container execution on a node.
- [Kube Proxy](/training/kubernetes-deep-dive/kube-proxy/) - Maintains network rules and service discovery.
- [Containerd](/training/kubernetes-deep-dive/containerd/) - A container runtime that runs and manages container lifecycles.

### Storage and Networking
- [Cloud Controllers](/training/kubernetes-deep-dive/cloud-controllers/) - Integrate Kubernetes with cloud providers for storage, networking, and load balancing.
- [Cluster DNS (CoreDNS)](/training/kubernetes-deep-dive/cluster-dns-coredns/) - Handles internal DNS resolution for services and pods.
- [CSI Driver](/training/kubernetes-deep-dive/csi-driver/) - Manages storage provisioning and volume attachments.
- [Kubectl](/training/kubernetes-deep-dive/kubectl/) - The command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes.
