# Project Brief: SupportTools Website

## Overview
SupportTools is a technical blog and resource website focused on providing expert guidance on Kubernetes, container technologies, and cloud-native solutions. The site contains blog posts, tutorials, troubleshooting guides, and resources for IT professionals and DevOps engineers.

## Core Requirements
- Publish high-quality technical content on Kubernetes and related technologies
- Provide troubleshooting guides and solutions to common problems
- Maintain a clean, accessible blog format
- Share expertise through detailed technical posts
- Establish thought leadership in Kubernetes and cloud-native space

## Content Strategy
- Create in-depth technical guides on specific technologies (e.g., Cilium, Kubernetes)
- Publish troubleshooting guides based on real-world experience
- Update guides periodically to reflect latest technology changes
- Create supplementary social media content to promote blog posts

## Publishing Workflow
1. Draft technical content in Markdown
2. Store blog posts directly in the blog/content/post/ directory (NOT in subdirectories)
3. Create accompanying social media posts organized in dedicated subdirectories:
   - Structure: social-media-post/[blog-post-name]/
   - Example: social-media-post/cilium-troubleshooting-2025/
   - Include platform-specific files (e.g., bluesky.md, linkedin.md)
4. Update URLs in social media posts to point to the correct blog post location
5. Publish to the website using appropriate deployment methods

## Recent Additions
- Advanced Cilium Troubleshooting Guide for 2025
- Social media posts (BlueSky and LinkedIn) for promoting content

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring for content updates needed
- Consider adding more troubleshooting guides for different technologies
- Explore adding more visual elements to guides (diagrams, flowcharts)
