## Current Work Focus
- **Cilium Troubleshooting Guide Update**: Created new in-depth guide for 2025 with advanced troubleshooting techniques
- **Social Media Content**: Developed BlueSky and LinkedIn posts to promote the new guide
- **Memory Bank Setup**: Established documentation structure for future work continuity

## Recent Changes
1. Created comprehensive `cilium-troubleshooting-2025.md` blog post with expanded content:
   - Advanced diagnostic techniques
   - In-depth cluster and pod connectivity troubleshooting
   - Performance diagnostics and optimization
   - Case studies with resolution paths
   - Automated troubleshooting approaches

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **CodeQL Configuration**: Prioritized custom workflow over default setup for better control and integration with CI/CD pipeline

## Next Steps
1. Consider setting up an image directory for blog post diagrams at `cdn.support.tools/posts/cilium-troubleshooting-2025/`
2. Evaluate metrics to track engagement with the new blog post
3. Explore additional social media platforms for content promotion
4. Identify follow-up topics that could complement the Cilium troubleshooting guide
